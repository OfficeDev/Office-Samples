## Required Steps & How to Run

### Prerequisites
To run the completed project in this folder, you need the following:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your development machine. (**Note:** This tutorial was written with Node version 16.14.0. The steps in this guide may work with other versions, but that has not been tested.)
- Either a personal Microsoft account with a mailbox on Outlook.com, or a Microsoft work or school account. You can [sign up for the Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program) to get a free Microsoft 365 subscription.

### Register a web application with the Azure Active Directory admin center
1. If you have an application ID already, please ensure: 

- In [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com) under **Identity > Applications > App registrations**: 
- Navigate to **Redirect URI**, set the first drop-down to `Single-page application (SPA)` and its value to `https://localhost:3000/consent.html`.

2. Otherwise, if you haven't registered a web application with the Azure Active Directory admin center, please follow the steps below:

- Open a browser and navigate to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com). Login using a **personal account** (aka: Microsoft Account) or **Work or School Account**.

- Select **Identity** in the left-hand navigation, then select **App registrations** under **Applications**.
- Select **New registration**. On the **App registrations** page, set the values as follows.
    - Set **Name** to `Office Add-in Graph Tutorial`.
    - Set **Supported account types** to **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts**.
    - Under **Redirect URI**, set the first drop-down to `Single-page application (SPA)` and set the value to `https://localhost:3000/consent.html`.

- Select **Register**. On the **Office Add-in Graph Tutorial** page, copy the value of the **Application (client) ID** and save it, you will need it in the next step.


### Configure the sample

1. Edit the `taskpane.js` file and make the following changes.
    - Replace `YOUR_APP_ID_HERE` with the **Application Id** you got from the App Registration Portal.
1. In your command-line interface (CLI), navigate to this directory and run the following command to install requirements.
    ```
    npm install
    ```

### Run the sample on Windows and Mac

Run the following command in your CLI to start the application.
```
npm run build
npm start
```

### Expected result

A webpack server will be hosted on https://localhost:3000/, as the CLI shows:
